List.c                  Provides service to Graph.c. Bi-directional List
List.h					List.c interface to communicate with clients
Graph.c                 Provides service to clients. In this case, provides servies to FindPath.c and GraphTest.c Adjacency list representation of graph.
Graph.h					Graph.c interface to communicate with clients
GraphTest.c             Used to do a brief test on Graph.c
FindPath.c              Main client, reads an inputfile of graph data and outputs an adjacency list representation of that graph and path ways to given source to vertex
Makefile                Used to compile all the files together
README					Brief description of all files
